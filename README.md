Details and documentation of the API can be found on their website: <https://api.swu.de/mobility/>.

Principle of using API requests: As much as necessary and as little as possible.

## Install

For installation use [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/swu_api/):

`pip install swu_api` or `pip3 install swu_api`

## Structure

The libary is divided into two components. One part deals with the request of the basedata and livedata (swu_functions.py). The other part (swu_helper.py) provides help functions to support requests.

The swu_helper is able to request data that changes infrequently (basedata) at a predefined interval and store it in a buffer. This reduces the number of queries.

With the help of swu_demo_data you can download examples of the API data and save them to a json file.

## Usage

Short example are listed below. Details are listed in the notebook [example_carsharing](https://github.com/CeKl/dev_swu_api/blob/main/examples/example_carsharing.ipynb) and [example_public_transport](https://github.com/CeKl/dev_swu_api/blob/main/examples/example_public_transport.ipynb).

### example for helper functions

#### public transport

Get information about public transport.

```python
from swu_api.swu_helper import swu_api_pt_helper

swu_pt_helper = swu_api_pt_helper(use_buffer=True)

# get data of station with searchterm for searchparameter
station_info = swu_pt_helper.get_station_info(serach_parameter='StopName', serach_term='Justizgeb√§ude')

# get informations for a given vehicle
vehicle_info = swu_pt_helper.get_vehicle_info(vehiclenumber=42)

# get direction of a given route
route_direction = swu_pt_helper.get_route_direction(routenumber=1)

# get routepoints for given route and direction
get_route = swu_pt_helper.get_route(routenumber=1, direction=1)
```

#### carsharing

Get information about carsharing.

```python
from swu_api.swu_helper import swu_api_cs_helper

swu_cs_helper = swu_api_cs_helper(use_buffer=True)

# get details of a station with given id
station_details = swu_cs_helper.get_station_details(station_id='5162')
```

### example for basic API request

Basic data of the SWU API.

```python
from swu_api.swu_fuctions import swu_pt_functions

swu_func = swu_pt_functions()

# get data of a route
route_data = swu_func.base_route(routenumber=1, contentscope='basic')

# get livedata of trip for given vehiclenumber
vehicle_trip = swu_func.live_vehicle_trip(vehiclenumber=42)

```

### save API examples

Save output of the API to a json file for further analyse.

```python
from swu_api.swu_demo_data import api_to_json

swu_demo = api_to_json(save_filter='all', folderpath='C:/Users/Default/Desktop/swu_data')

```
